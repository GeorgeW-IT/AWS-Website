# AWS Cloud Portfolio Project

This project showcases my experience with AWS Cloud services. It includes screenshots and descriptions of the resources I created and configured.

## Key Services Used
- **EC2 Instances** – Deployed virtual servers in the cloud.  
- **S3 Buckets** – Configured storage for files and backups.  
- **VPC & Subnets** – Set up networking and security.
